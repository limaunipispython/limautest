Recap on what have i done now

1. in settings.py 
    - include site_id=1 
    - include django.contrib.sites and django_comments into installed_app list

2. in urls.py 
    - include in urlpatterns list :  url(r'^comments/', include('django_comments.urls')), 

3. in article_single.html
    - {% load comments %} - template tag?
    - get_comment_count
    - to render all comments for particular instance(article) there are two methods 
        1. fast : render_comment_list -> html can be customized in some files in package directory
        2. slower but with option to customize html in particular template: 
            - get_comment_list for article as comments ->creating dictionary of comments 
    - to render the form
        1. fast : render_comment_form  
        2. slower but with option to customize html in particular template:
            - get_comment_form as comment form ->can use bootstrap
