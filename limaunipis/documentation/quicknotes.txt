COMPLETE USER RECIPE MODEL

Objective
- to create user field in models.py
    - code : user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User') - done
- create UserRecipe form in forms.py to post UserRecipe models instance - done
- create newRecipePost view to handle new post and submit post instance - done
- link newRecipePost with url - done
- create html form to handle newRecipePost - done
- draft view and html for userRecipeSingle
- create editRecipePost view to handle edit post 
- link editRecipePost with url
- in base.html find place to put the link for user to post new_recipe and isolate only from
  authenticated user
- create html to display list of user posted recipe and picture
- create html to display single page of user recipe as well
- optimize user recipe to include ingredients
- solve how to only allow logged in user to post user recipe - right now it would give error     

issues
- currently when edit post it create another post instance instead of editing the current post
- all user can see the edit button so they can change the content
    - we want only user who create the post able to see the edit button -OK
- the picture need to be reuploaded if post edit

PLAN ON HOW TO TACKLE THE INSTANCE PROBLEM

1. in user_recipe_edit view change the template to point to newly created userrecipeform_edit.html
2. copy userrecipeform content into userrecipeform_edit.html
3. point the action attribute of the html form to user_recipe_edit
4. specify in the user_recipe_edit if the request == 'POST' form = UserRecipeForm(request.POST, instance=user_recipe)
5. assumption if we define the form as in step 4 the user_recipe.save() method would update the model rather than create new instance
