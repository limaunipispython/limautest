- in base.html find place to put the link for user to post new_recipe and isolate only from
  authenticated user
- create html to display list of user posted recipe and picture
- create html to display single page of user recipe as well
- optimize user recipe to include ingredients
- solve how to only allow logged in user to post user recipe - right now it would give error     

issues
- currently when edit post it create another post instance instead of editing the current post
- all user can see the edit button so they can change the content
    - we want only user who create the post able to see the edit button
- the picture need to be reuploaded if post edits
