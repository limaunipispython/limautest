COMPLETE USER RECIPE MODEL

Objective
- to create user field in models.py
    - code : user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User') - done
- create UserRecipe form in forms.py to post UserRecipe models instance - done
- create newRecipePost view to handle new post and submit post instance - done
- link newRecipePost with url - done
- create html form to handle newRecipePost - done
- draft view and html for userRecipeSingle - done
- create editRecipePost view to handle edit post - done
- link editRecipePost with url - done
-> in base.html find place to put the link for user to post new_recipe and isolate only from
  authenticated user
-> create html to display list of user posted recipe and picture
- create html to display single page of user recipe as well
- optimize user recipe to include ingredients
- solve how to only allow logged in user to post user recipe - right now it would give error     

How To Do:
1. put bootstrap html button right below 'welcome guest' notification for desktop 
2. link button to user_recipe_post url
3. arrange item in the sidebar to include new user posted recipe
4. create html with ajax to display user posted recipe list (user_recipe_entries.html)
4. link USER POSTED RECIPE header in the sidebar to user_recipe_entries.html
5. create link to user_recipe_entries on navbar - for mobile users
6. update user_recipe_single.html to be better follow standard -- need to draft the wireframe and update model
